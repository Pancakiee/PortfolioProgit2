            <h2>Activities</h2>
            <p>During my studies, I successfully completed several projects that showcased my dedication to code,
                creativity, and problem-solving abilities. These projects ranged from tackling complex programming
                challenges to innovative solutions in various domains, allowing me to gain invaluable hands-on
                experience and refine my skills. Each project was a stepping stone in my academic journey, demonstrating
                my commitment to continuous learning and growth in the field.</p>

                                <p>This recent activity got me face palming myself because I was not able to review the
                                    topics that were part of the quiz.</p>

                                <p>This activity was focused on the inheritance of classes. I learned through this
                                    activity that we consider making use of the the protected modifier to allow the
                                    child class to access it.</p>

                                <p>Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method
                                    that is already defined in its superclass. When a subclass provides a specific
                                    implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass, it is said to
                                    override the method.</p>

                    expected. It turns out that there are still parts of the topic that I was not able to fully
                    understand. Although I was still happy because I was able to answer the activity in a way that I
                    understood the topic. The only down side of this activity was I was not able to collaborate well
                    with my partner since she was not able to understand the topic as well.</p>

                <p><b>Encapsulation:</b><br>

                    <b>Coding Aspect:</b> Encapsulation is defined as the bundling of data and methods that operate on
                    the data into a single unit, known as a class. This promotes data hiding and reduces the complexity
                    of the code.<br>

                    <b>Daily Life Lesson:</b> Encapsulation can be applied to personal organization. Similar to how a
                    class encapsulates related data and methods, personal organization involves grouping related tasks,
                    items, or responsibilities together.In a digital context, this could involve organizing your files,
                    folders, or digital tools in a structured manner. Grouping related documents or applications
                    together on your computer or device can help streamline your digital workflow. Encapsulation in
                    personal organization leads to improved productivity and efficiency. It minimizes the time and
                    effort spent searching for items or switching between tasks.

                <h2>What are the new insights/discoveries that I learned?</h2>

                <p><b>Inheritance</b> is one of the fundamental principles of OOP that allows a new class (subclass or
                    derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base
                    class). The subclass can then extend or override these inherited attributes, promoting code reuse
                    and creating a hierarchical relationship between classes. Inheritance allows a class to inherit
                    properties and behaviors from another class. This means that a subclass can acquire the attributes
                    and methods of its parent class without having to redefine them. The subclass automatically gains
                    access to the fields and methods of the superclass.</p>
